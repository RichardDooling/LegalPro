###### Lawyers & Clients: Fiduciary Duty

- class3 
- class4
- class5

### Required Reading

#### Martyn & Fox

* Please read Chapter 3 "Beginning The Lawyer Client Relationship" (pages 55-84)
* INSTEAD OF READING M&F Chapter 2 "Judicial and Professional Regulation of Lawyers" (pages 23-54), please just familiarize yourself with these rules and read my notes below.

#### ABA Model Rules

* [Model Rule 1.2: "Scope of Representation & Allocation of Authority Between Client & Lawyer"][aba1.2] 
* [Model Rule 1.6(a) "Confidentiality"][aba1.6] (Just skim; we spend two weeks on it later!)
* [Model Rule 6.1: "Voluntary Pro Bono Publico Service"][aba6.1]
* [Model Rule 6.2: "Accepting Appointments"][aba6.2]
* [Model Rule 6.4: "Law Reform Activities Affecting Client Interests"][aba6.4]
* [Model Rule 8.1 "Bar Admission & Disciplinary Matters"][aba8.1]
* [Model Rule 8.3 "Reporting Professional Misconduct"][aba8.3]
* [Model Rule 8.4 "Misconduct"][aba8.4]
* [Model Rule 1.18: "Duties to Prospective Client"][aba1.18]

#### Model Rule 8.1

###### Bar Admission & Disciplinary Matters

* An applicant for admission to the bar (or a lawyer in connection with a bar admission application or in connection with a disciplinary matter) shall not:
    * knowingly make a false statement of material fact; 
    * fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension . . . 
    * except that this rule *does NOT require disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.*

#### Model Rule 8.3

###### Reporting Professional Misconduct

(a) A lawyer who knows that another lawyer has committed a violation of the Rules . . . *that raises a substantial question as to that lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer* . . . shall inform the appropriate professional authority.
(b) Same for judges . . . 
(c) This Rule *does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6 or information gained by a lawyer or judge while participating in an approved lawyers assistance program.*

#### Duty to Report vs. Duty of Confidentiality

Model Rules [8.1][aba8.1]: (Bar Admission & Disciplinary Matters) and [8.3][aba8.3]: (Reporting Professional Misconduct) are good examples of Rules that REQUIRE a lawyer to INFORM, REPORT, or DISCLOSE information. Whenever a Rule requires disclosure of information it will also indicate whether the duty to report or disclose information TRUMPS the lawyer's duty of confidentiality to her client, or IS TRUMPED by that duty. 

For example, Model Rules 8.1 and 8.3 both *do not require disclosure of information protected by Rule 1.6 (Confidentiality)*. How does that work? 

Suppose in looking over your client's case you discover that the lawyer who had the case before you stole money from your client, meaning, the lawyer committed professional misconduct that raises a substantial question about the lawyer's fitness to practice law. Normally, you have a duty to report this violation under [Model Rule 8.3][aba8.3]. Of course you tell your client about your discovery and urge your client to report the former lawyer's unethical behavior. But the client does not wish to disclose this information, because it's too much trouble, or perhaps because it will make her look foolish. Your [Model Rule 1.6][aba1.6] duty to protect client confidential information TRUMPS your Model Rule 8.3 duty to report misconduct, and you are not required to report the former lawyer's misconduct.

Compare instead what happens under [Model Rule 3.3][aba3.3], which also requires the lawyer to disclose information in the following subsections presented here in truncated form:

#### Model Rule 3.3

###### Candor Toward The Tribunal

(a) A lawyer shall not knowingly:
    1. . . . *fail to correct a false statement of material fact or law previously made* to the tribunal by the lawyer;
    2. *fail to disclose to the tribunal legal authority in the controlling jurisdiction* . . .  or
    3. . . . If a lawyer, the lawyer’s client, or a witness called by the lawyer, has offered material evidence and the lawyer comes to know of its falsity, the lawyer shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if necessary, *disclosure to the tribunal*. 
(b) A lawyer who represents a client in an adjudicative proceeding and who knows that a person intends to engage, is engaging or has engaged in criminal or fraudulent conduct related to the proceeding shall take reasonable remedial measures, including, if necessary, *disclosure to the tribunal*.
(c) The duties stated in paragraphs (a) and (b) continue to the conclusion of the proceeding, and *apply even if compliance requires disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.*

Here the lawyer's [Model Rule 3.3][aba3.3] duty of candor to the tribunal TRUMPS the lawyer's [Model Rule 1.6][aba1.6] duty of confidentiality to the client. In other words, even if the client insists that the lawyer not disclose information covered by the terms of Rule 3.3, the lawyer must do so. 

Others have looked at these competing duties and seen, not conflict, but a harmonious heirarchy of duties:

> The lawyer has a specific duty to preserve the confidence of the client, but that duty is subordinate to an equally specific duty not to participate in fraud upon the court. A hierarchy of duties--not a conflict--exists.[^noonan]

###  Access to Justice:

#### *Bothwell v. Republic Tobacco* (D.NE 1995)

* In federal court, at least, judges can appoint lawyers in both criminal and civil cases, especially for indigent or unpopular litigants who can't otherwise get counsel.
* Court will conduct analysis on whether client can't get a lawyer because client is indigent, or their cause is unpopular, as opposed to just having a really bad case. 

#### Model Rule 6.1

###### Voluntary Pro Bono Publico Service

Every lawyer has a professional responsibility to provide legal services to those unable to pay. A lawyer SHOULD aspire to render at least (50) hours of pro bono publico legal services per year. In fulfilling this responsibility, the lawyer should:

* Provide a substantial majority of the (50) hours of legal services without fee or expectation of fee to:
    * persons of limited means or
    * charitable, religious, civic, community, governmental and educational organizations in matters that are designed primarily to address the needs of persons of limited means; and
* deliver legal services at no fee or substantially reduced fee to individuals, groups or organizations seeking to secure or protect civil rights.&hellip; 

#### Model Rule 1.2(c)

###### Providing Limited Representation:

* Model Rule 1.2(c)
    * Lawyer and client may agree to limit scope of representation if it's reasonable to do so under the circumstances.
    * Thus, things like Brief Ghostwriting, etc. are often permissible unless your jurisdiction requires you to enter appearance on behalf of litigant.

[Nebraska's version of this Rule](http://tinyurl.com/ouu6hkd) explicitly permits limited scope representations.

#### Model Rule 6.2

###### Accepting Appointments:

* A lawyer shall not seek to avoid appointment by a tribunal to represent a person except for good cause, such as:
    * Representing client is likely to result in ethics violation;
    * Unreasonable financial burden on lawyer;
    * Client is so repugnant to lawyer that lawyer probably won't be able to do a good job or get along with the client.

#### Model Rule 2.1

###### Duties as Advisor to Client:

* Lawyer shall:
    * Exercise independent professional judgment and render candid advice; 
* Lawyer May:
    * Refer not only to LAW, but other considerations, including (1) moral (2) economic (3) ethical (4) social and (5) political factors.
* May include information from non-lawyer professionals. 
* If the matter involves litigation, lawyer SHOULD also inform client of alternative dispute resolution, but so far NOT REQUIRED. Still a very good idea, depending on the circumstances. 

#### Accidental Clients

##### Preamble & Scope Comment 17

Lawyers talk to lawyers, nonlawyers, judges, clients, beneficiaries of clients, officers and directors of clients, and on and on. Some of these people are previous clients, some are current clients, others are prospective clients. Some are just friends, but friends become clients, and clients become friends. Who is a client? And what must lawyer or client do to turn a conversation about the law at a cocktail party into an attorney-client relationship? 

The [Preamble & Scope][] to the Model Rules tells us that "principles of substantive law external to these Rules determine whether a client-lawyer relationship exists." And the cases in our text illustrate that general proposition. 

A more important question: When do lawyers owe DUTIES to clients, nonclients, prospective clients, former clients?

> Most of the duties flowing from the client-lawyer relationship attach only after the client has requested the lawyer to render legal services and the lawyer has agreed to do so. But there are some duties, such as that of [confidentiality under Rule 1.6][aba1.6], that attach when the lawyer agrees to consider whether a client-lawyer relationship shall be established. See [Rule 1.18][aba1.18]. Whether a client-lawyer relationship exists for any specific purpose can depend on the circumstances and may be a question of fact.

#### RLGL &sect; 14 

[RLGL &sect; 14: "Formation of a Client-Lawyer Relationship"][RLGL-14]

The lawyer-client relationship arises when a person wants the lawyer to provide legal services and EITHER:

* the lawyer consents, OR
* the lawyer FAILS TO MANIFEST LACK OF CONSENT.

#### *Togstadt* and Common Sense

A prospective client seeks advice from a lawyer. Afterwards the lawyer may feel like she had no more than a conversation about possible future employment. But if the client comes away with a reasonable belief that the lawyer has taken the case or dispensed legal advice, then presto! The client has the right to rely on the advice dispensed. 

Lawyers must learn to be clear about who their clients are. If someone interviews the lawyer about a possible case, and the lawyer declines the representation by saying, "No I can't take your case" then lawyer should send a [nonengagement letter](http://tinyurl.com/ksnvsy9). Otherwise, the lawyer may unwittingly enter into an attorney-client relationship if the client has a reasonable belief that there is such a relationship.

* For example, lawyer says: "I don't think you have a case, but I'll talk to my senior partner and get back to you." (*Togstadt*)
    * While client waits for lawyer to get back to her, the statute of limitations runs. 
* A lawyer may enter into an attorney-client relationship if the lawyer gives legal advice to a person who reasonably relies on it, even at social gatherings or on social media. 
* How to Avoid these "accidental clients"?
   * Simple direct statements: "This is not legal advice!" Or, "I cannot be your lawyer!" Then take whatever question the person asked and cast it as a hypothetical.
* Send non-engagement letters. 
* Train non-lawyer office staff. Even staff may inadvertently give impression that an attorney-client relationship has been formed, so lawyers must train them to avoid this.

* [Wealth Inequality In America](http://youtu.be/QPKKQnijnsM)
    * We don't discuss income inequality. Rather, this supports my belief that half the country can't afford legal services under the traditional billable-hour, fee-for-service model. See also: [Time Magazine: Half of Americans Live Paycheck-To-Paycheck](http://business.time.com/2014/01/30/nearly-half-of-america-lives-paycheck-to-paycheck/)
    * I believe that your generation of lawyers will leverage technology and find a way to serve these clients. The new client-service models and fee arrangements will involve the usual [creative destruction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction) and [disruptive innovation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation) we see across the board in other industries. It's just that law and lawyers are way behind the curve.

#### Martyn & Fox

* Read Chapter 4 (85-127), skipping Antioch Trust (92-97). HOWEVER, if somebody is an ERISA, Employee Benefits Wiz, or Corporate whiz who wants to explain the complexity while I ask ethical questions, please let me know. 
* Just Skim and peruse 108-118 (Maples, Frye, and Lafler). If you might end up doing criminal law, I would read these carefully. If somebody with criminal expertise wants to discuss these three SHORT cases, I will ask the ethical questions and you can explain the criminal law to us. Either way, I want to move quickly athrough these to the end of Chapter 4. 
* Read Chapter 5 (129-133), just the first part of Competence and the *Orr* case.

* [Model Rule 1.1: "Competence"][aba1.1]
* [Model Rule 1.2: "Scope of Representation & Allocation of Authority Between Client & Lawyer"][aba1.2]
* [Model Rule 1.3: "Diligence"][aba1.3]
* [Model Rule 1.4: "Communication"][aba1.4]

* [Model Rule 1.14: "Client with Diminished Capacity"][aba1.14]
* [Model Rule 2.1: "Advisor"][aba2.1]

#### Allocation of authority

Chapter 4 begins with references to the 
[Restatement (Third) Of Agency § 1.01 (2006)](http://tinyurl.com/mhaqbe8) 
and the 
[RLGL: § 16 A Lawyer's Duties to a Client—In General](http://tinyurl.com/n5blksw).

Review the [breakdown of Model Rule 1.2](#scope) ("Scope of Representation & Allocation of Authority") from the first week.

Review the table at M&F3rd (p. 86) on allocation of authority. 
This is the ethical rule, but it has deep roots in the common law of ageny. 
It attempts to answer a question as old as the human race: 
Who's in charge? Who's the boss? 
Answer: Usually the client. 
The client is the principal; the lawyer is the agent.

The agent (the lawyer) agrees to act on behalf of a principal (the client) 
subject to the client/principal’s control. 
The highest standard of care! Super fiduciaries! 
The authority to *ACT* on behalf of the client/principal 
imposes on the lawyer/agent fiduciary duties to ensure 
that the lawyer/agent acts on the client/principal’s behalf 
and under the client/principal’s control.

Under agency law and the law governling lawyers, 
the lawyer/agent's authority to act 
for the client/principal may be *actual* or *apparent*:

* Actual authority
    * Implied authority (actual authority circumstantially proved)
* Apparent authority
    * Client/principal ACTS like agent has authority;
    * Third party REASONABLY BELIEVES lawyer/agent has authority.
    * If later, third party learns lawyer/agent did NOT have actual authority, then third party usually may seek redress from BOTH the client and the lawyer.

#### WHO IS THE CLIENT?

* *Machado* p. 89. The lawyer forgets who is in charge.

#### Communications to Clients:

M&F3rd (p. 98) describes eight events that trigger a lawyer's duty to communicate with clients. Here is an abbreviated summary.

* [Rule 1.4 (Communications):][aba1.4] Lawyer must communicate and sometimes obtain client consent before acting on client's behalf, especially to establish the following:
    - Fees, scope of representation, client objectives or change of objectives (see engagement letters).
    - Waiver of any fiduciary obligations.
    - To explain any matter to the extent reasonably necessary to obtain the client's informed consent. 
    - To make decisions about means to accomplish objectives.
    - Updates (e.g. lawyer took money out of trust account).
    - When lawyer can't give assistance (because doing so would violate one or more Model Rules or other law)
    - When lawyer makes a mistake!
    - When client requests information.

#### Corporations, Entities, Organizations as Clients

[Rule 1.13 (Organization as Client)][aba1.13] A L-O-N-G rule and the comments are a big help. When the organization itself is the client, the entity constitutes a distinct legal person apart from any individual constituent or aggregate of individual constituents as a whole. 

* In *Antioch Litigation Trust v. McDermott Will and Emery LLP,* instead of representing the entity, the lawyers represented the interests of the entity's primary shareholders. 
* When the organization's lawyer speaks to an individual employee, the lawyer must make clear that she represents THE ORGANIZATION and NOT the individual employee. The conversation is privileged only so far as the employee is acting on behalf of the corporation. 

#### Multiple Clients/Dual Representation:

* Appropriate conflict of interest waivers must be in place to represent two or more clients.
* Lawyer owes same duties to BOTH clients regardless of who pays the bill.
* *DePape v. Trinity Health* Case p. M&F3rd p. 100.
    * The Canadian doctor case.
    * Lawyer must COMMUNICATE with BOTH clients, owes all super fiduciary duties to BOTH.

#### Elements of Legal Malpractice Claims:

1. Existence of attorney-client relationship.
2. Attorney, by acting or failing to act, breaches duty.
3. Breach proximately causes damages.
4. Client sustains actual loss or injury.

##### Legal Malpractice v. Ethics Violation:

* Ethics violations are not independently actionable, but
* The ethics rules provide guidance in determining the fiduciary duty owed to client.
* [RLGL &sect; 49: Breach of Fiduciary Duty](http://tinyurl.com/kx8rh8s)
* Lawyer liable for legal malpractice if:
    1. Lawyer breaches fiduciary duty to client, and
    2. Breaches causes injury.

#### Ineffective Assistance of Counsel

* Different than legal malpractice!
* Elements ([*Strickland v. Washington* (Sct. 1984)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strickland_v._Washington))
* To justify reversal in a criminal case, the defendant must show:
    1. Lawyer's acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professional competence;
    2. Actual prejudice (I would have won or gotten a lighter sentence or some other meaningful disposition BUT FOR the lawyer's incompetence). 

##### Competent Representation at Plea Bargaining Stage:

* *Missouri v. Frye* adds requirement that court would have accepted the plea deal (part of the actual prejudice prong);
* Must tell client about plea bargain possibilities.

##### Some Exemplary Reversals (M&F3rd p. 122 fns)

* *Cottle* - It is ineffective assistance to fail to tell client about plea offer from prosecutor.
* *Burdine* - Ineffective assistance where lawyer slept through large parts of criminal trial.
* *Glover* -  Failure to "group" charges led to enhanced prison time.

##### Post-Conviction Relief:

* *Maples* - Ineffective counsel if client abandoned by counsel and because of that client reasonably fails to make proper appeals.
* *Lafler v. Cooper* - Lawyer told client there's no way client can be convicted of attempted murder because he shot someone below the waist. Huh?
    * Clearly wrong and court sustains ineffective counsel claim because this legal advice falls far outside that wide range of professional competent assistance. 
    * Remedy: Re-offer plea agreement and watch Justice Scalia throw a temper tantrum.

#### Ethics 20/20 Commission on Globalization & Technology

In 2009, then ABA President Carolyn B. Lamm created the [ABA Commission on Ethics 20/20][aba-2020] to perform a thorough review of the ABA Model Rules of Professional Conduct and the U.S. system of lawyer regulation in the context of advances in technology and global legal practice developments.

Why is technology going so fast? Why is it so hard to keep up with Westlaw, Lexis, Linked-In, Facebook, Twitter, presentation software and technologies, litigation support software, docketing programs, conflict of interest software?

Answer: [Moore's Law][moore]. You need only read the first few sentences to apprehend that technology grows at an EXPONENTIAL rate. We lawyer/humans do NOT grow exponentially, so we have to work extra hard to keep up with technology.

#### Competence & Technology

Model Rule 1.1 is deceptively straightforward: 

"A lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client." 

Easy, right? But Model Rule 1.1 is a master rule of sorts. 
If you are a Tolkien fan, there is one ring to rule them all, 
and Model Rule 1.1 requiring COMPETENCE is one rule to rule them all, 
because we must COMPETENTLY protect client confidentiality, 
COMPETENTLY avoid client conflicts, 
COMPETENTLY avoid waiving the attorney-client privilege. 
And to do all of those things, 
including COMPETENTLY communicate with our clients, 
we must COMPETENTLY use technology.

As of August 2012, 
the Ethics 20/20 Commission added a new comment 8 to Rule 1.1 "Competence".

##### Comment 8: Maintaining Competence

> To maintain the requisite knowledge and skill, 
> a lawyer should keep abreast of changes in the law and its practice, 
> *including the benefits and risks associated 
> with relevant technology*, 
> engage in continuing study and education 
> and comply with all continuing legal education requirements 
> to which the lawyer is subject.

So the command to keep abreast of changing technologies is now explicit. Just one of many changes wrought by the new [Ethics 20/20 Commission][aba-2020].

#### Nebraska Relaxes Privity Rule

#####Perez v. Stern (NE 2010)

* Nebraska relaxes the privity requirement in estate planning actions.

* Privity was not required in an action by the mother of decedent’s children (as next friend) against an attorney who allowed the statute of limitations to run on a wrongful death claim regarding their father’s death made on behalf of the children.
 
* The court held the attorney had an independent duty to the children, as decedent’s next of kin, to timely prosecute the wrongful death claim.

SEPTEMBER 11, 2013 BY DANE S. CIOLINO](http://lalegalethics.org/lawyers-stop-worrying-using-public-wi-fi-networks/)

including "Reasonable Efforts"

and with an every expanding definition of what is "reasonable" 

For instance, the California Bar has proposed that lawyers represening clients needing ediscovery services who are likely to engage in for instance now California proposes that if e-discovery is likely you must acquire or hire some very demanding expertise.

-->

#### Leveraging Your Tech Skills

An ABA Ethics tip [Competence: Acquire it or Hire it!]( http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/services/ethicsearch/ethicstipofthemonthmay2014.html), published in May of 2014 propose that lawyers must be competent in legal tech, or must hire or associate with lawyers who are. 

[California Proposed Opinion NO. 11-0004 (2014)](http://www.americanbar.org/groups/professional_responsibility/services/ethicsearch/ethicstipofthemonthmay2014.html) says that if e-discovery is likely, then a California lawyer must:

> assess his or her own e-discovery skills and resources 
> as part of the attorney’s duty 
> to provide the client with competent representation. 
> If an attorney lacks such skills and/or resources, 
> the attorney must take steps to acquire sufficient learning and skill, 
> or associate or consult with someone 
> with appropriate expertise to assist. Rule 3-110(C).&hellip; 

> Attorneys handling e-discovery 
> should have the requisite level of familiarity and skill to, 
> among other things, be able to perform 
> (either by themselves or in association 
> with competent co-counsel or expert consultants) the following:

> 1. initially assess e-discovery needs and issues, if any;
> 2. implement appropriate ESI preservation procedures, including the obligation to advise a client of the legal requirement to take actions to preserve evidence, like electronic information, potentially relevant to the issues raised in the litigation;
> 3. analyze and understand a client’s ESI systems and storage;
> 4. identify custodians of relevant ESI;
> 5. perform appropriate searches;

- [Section 60: Lawyers Duty to Safeguard Confidential Information][RLGL-60]

### Confidentiality

Confidentiality? Leave it to lawyers to come up with a seven-syllable abstraction for trust and loyalty. Client's pay good money for both, and they expect good judgment and absolute discretion about their legal and business affairs. Patients don't like it when their doctors blab to others about their diseases. And clients don't like it when their lawyers blab to others (including other lawyers) about their client's business and legal affairs. 

Lawyers tend to assume that the duty of confidentiality applies only to information the client shares in confidence. The client says, "Don't tell anybody, but here's what really happened."
The duty of confidentiality is much broader. The Model Rules put it this way:

> The confidentiality rule, for example, applies not only to matters communicated in confidence by the client but also to **all information relating to the representation, whatever its source**. A lawyer may not disclose such information except as authorized or required by the Rules of Professional Conduct or other law. [Model Rule 1.6 Comment 3.][aba1.6-3]

Confidentiality is a 24/7 open all night BROAD duty to keep your mouth shut about your client affairs. Other duties to keep secrets are much narrower: 

> The attorney-client privilege and work product doctrine apply in judicial and other proceedings in which a lawyer may be called as a witness or otherwise required to produce evidence concerning a client.

> The principle of client-lawyer confidentiality is given effect by related bodies of law: the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine and the rule of confidentiality established in professional ethics.

> The rule of client-lawyer confidentiality applies in situations other than those where evidence is sought from the lawyer through compulsion of law. 


#### Exception for "generally known" information?

Many lawyers think that client information is not confidential if it is part of a public record somewhere. The Model Rules contain no such exception.

The [RLGL &sect;59][RLGL-59] does contain such an exception, but it's quite narrow:

d. Generally known information. Confidential client information does not include information that is generally known . . . . At the same time, the fact that information has become known to some others does not deprive it of protection if it has not become generally known in the relevant sector of the public.

> Whether information is generally known depends on all circumstances relevant in obtaining the information. Information contained in books or records in public libraries, public-record depositaries such as government offices, or in publicly accessible electronic-data storage is generally known if the particular information is obtainable through publicly available indexes and similar methods of access. **Information is not generally known when a person interested in knowing the information could obtain it only by means of special knowledge or substantial difficulty or expense.** Special knowledge includes information about the whereabouts or identity of a person or other source from which the information can be acquired, if those facts are not themselves generally known.

* So even under [RLGL &sect;59][RLGL-59]: KNOWN &#8800; GENERALLY KNOWN.
* Just because some others may know about client information, or a record of it exists somewhere, does NOT mean the information is "generally known."
* When in doubt, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.
* If you feel the need to disclose confidential client information, 
consult the Rule 1.6 confidentiality exceptions that apply in your jurisdiction, 
then get some good advice about how to proceed.

### Attorney-Client Privilege

A NARROW evidentiary rule compared to the broad ethical duty of confidentially.

##### What kinds of communications are protected by the attorney-client privilege?

* A communication
* Made in confidence
* To obtain or provide legal assistance for client

Client can't be compelled to answer the question: 
What did you say or write to the attorney? 
But client may be forced to testify about relevant facts, 
even if client discussed facts with attorney.

##### Who are "privileged persons?"

* Lawyer
    - agents
    - representatives
* Client (includes prospective clients)
    - agents
    - representatives

### Work Product Doctrine

The work-product doctrine protects materials prepared in anticipation of litigation 
from discovery by opposing counsel.

##### FRCP 26(b)(3)

* Documents and Tangible Things. 
* Ordinarily, a party may not discover documents and tangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or for trial by or for another party or its representative . . . .

##### Ordinary vs. Opinon Work Product

- *Hickman v. Taylor* – “ordinary work” work product may be obtained in discovery upon a showing of “substantial need.”
- [RLGL &sect;89](http://tinyurl.com/kq6nkqj): "Opinion work product is immune from discovery . . . unless . . . extraordinary circumstances justify disclosure.

#### Lawyer Who Underidentifies with Client

As Judge Noonan puts it: We are lawyers to clients, not lawyers to the situation.

> At the heart of the situation is the lawyer's desire to abstract himself from the needs and pressures of a particular individual in order to go on and straighten out a mess. In some other world, law could be practiced in that fashion. It is not the way law has been generally practiced in ours.[^noonan]

## Confidentiality & Encryption

###### Lawyers May Need to Encrypt E-Mail In Especially Risky or Sensitive Scenarios

Having read reports about email accounts being hacked and the National Security Agency obtaining email communications without a search warrant, [inquiring] lawyers are concerned about whether it is proper for them to continue using email to communicate confidential information. 

The panel said that although it “has not addressed the propriety of communicating confidential information by email, many other ethics committees have [concluded that] except in special circumstances, the use of email, including unencrypted email, is a proper method of communicating confidential information.”

The committee agreed with those authorities.

"[C]onsidering the present state of technology and email usage, a lawyer may generally communicate confidential information by email," it said. "Some circumstances, may, however, cause a lawyer to have a duty to advise a client regarding risks incident to the sending or receiving of emails arising from those circumstances and to consider whether it is prudent to use encrypted email or another form of communication."

As for what circumstances may justify a departure from the general rule, the committee said lawyers should consider using encryption when:

* communicating about “highly sensitive or confidential” matters;
* “sending an email to or from an account that the email sender or recipient shares with others”;
* “sending an email to a client when it is possible that a third person (such as a spouse in a divorce case) knows the password to the email account, or to an individual client at that client's work email account, especially if the email relates to [an] employment dispute”;
* “sending an email from a public computer or a borrowed computer or where the lawyer knows that the emails the lawyer sends are being read on a public or borrowed computer or on an unsecure network”;
* “sending an email if the lawyer knows that the email recipient is accessing the email on devices that are potentially accessible to third persons or are not protected by a password”; or
* “sending an email if the lawyer is concerned that the NSA or other law enforcement agency may read the communication, with or without a warrant.”

> After Mr. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme collapsed in December 2008, JPMorgan’s lawyers conducted an internal investigation of how he had used the bank to further his scheme. In 2012, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the bank’s primary regulator, started its own investigation of possible wrongdoing related to his accounts.

> Unless JPMorgan was willing to waive confidentiality, the only way to obtain the materials was to show that the clients — JPMorgan employees — sought legal advice to further a crime or fraud. Known as the crime-fraud exception, it allows a court to compel a lawyer to produce information about a client that would otherwise not be available.

##### *Nix v. Whiteside* (Sct. 1986)

Defendant Whiteside and some others 
went to Calvin Love’s apartment looking for drugs. 
An argument broke out, 
and Love allegedly told his girlfriend to get “his piece,” 
and then returned to bed. 

According to Whiteside, 
Love then started to reach under his pillow 
and made a move toward him. 

Fearing for his life, 
Whiteside stabbed Love in the chest and killed him. 

Whiteside was charged with murder. 
He told his court-appointed lawyer 
that he stabbed Love 
because he thought Love was pulling a gun from under his pillow. 

After further questioning by his attorney, 
Whiteside admitted that he had not actually seen a weapon. 

No pistol was found on the premises. 
Whiteside's lawyer interviewed Whiteside's companions 
who were present during the stabbing, 
and none had seen a gun during the incident. 

Whiteside's lawyer explained to Whiteside 
that he could claim self-defense 
even if he had not actually seen a gun, 
as long as he reasonably believed that a gun was nearby. 
And Whiteside consistently told his lawyer 
that he had not actually seen a gun, 
but that he was convinced that Love had a gun in his hand. 

About a week before trial, 
during preparation for direct examination, 
Whiteside for the first time told his lawyer 
that he had seen something “metallic” in Love's hand. 
When asked about this, Whiteside responded:

> If I don't say I saw a gun, I'm dead.

Whiteside's lawyer said that such testimony would be perjury. 
When Whiteside insisted that he would testify that he saw “something metallic,” 
his lawyer testified that he warned Whiteside as follows: 

> [W]e could not allow him to [testify falsely] 
> because that would be perjury, 
> and as officers of the court we would be suborning perjury 
> if we allowed him to do it.&hellip; 
> I advised him that if he did do that 
> it would be my duty to advise the Court 
> of what he was doing 
> and that I felt he was committing perjury; 
> also, that I probably would be allowed 
> to attempt to impeach that particular testimony.

Whiteside's lawyer also indicated 
he would seek to withdraw from the representation 
if Whiteside insisted on committing perjury.

At trial, 
Whiteside testified he knew Love had a gun 
and believed Love was reaching for a gun 
when he acted in self-defense. 
On cross, Whiteside admitted he had not actually seen a gun. 

Whiteside was found guilty of second degree murder, 
and moved for a new trial claiming he was deprived of a fair trial 
by his lawyer’s warnings not to testify about the gun. 

The Supreme Court of Iowa affirmed the conviction 
and held that the right to counsel 
does not extend to assisting the client to commit perjury. 

The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals granted Whiteside's petition 
for a writ of habeas corpus 
and accepted the findings of the trial judge and the Iowa Supreme Court. 

However the Eighth Circuit reasoned that, 
even though Whiteside had told his lawyer 
that he intended to commit perjury, 
Whiteside still had a right to effective assistance of counsel. 
The lawyer's threat to tell the court about Whiteside's planned perjury 
violated the attorney’s duty to preserve client privilege 
and also threatened Whiteside's right to effective assistance of counsel. 

Citing [*Strickland v. Washington*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strickland_v._Washington). 

**Issue:** If an attorney warns his client 
that he will inform the court of the client’s plan to commit perjury 
does that violate a defendant’s right 
to effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment?

**Held:** No. The Supreme Court (9-0) reversed the Eighth Circuit 
and denied habeas corpus. 

> In *Strickland*, we held that to obtain relief under the Sixth Amendment, 
> the moving party must establish both serious attorney error and prejudice.

> We recognized counsel's duty of loyalty 
> and his “overarching duty to advocate the defendant's cause.” 
> Plainly, that duty is limited to legitimate, lawful conduct 
> compatible with the very nature of a trial as a search for truth. 
> Although counsel must take all reasonable lawful means 
> to attain the objectives of the client, 
> counsel is precluded from taking steps 
> or in any way assisting the client 
> in presenting false evidence or otherwise violating the law. 

The Court found that Whiteside's lawyer 
had acted according to accepted norms of professional conduct. 
Defendant Whiteside had been allowed to testify, 
and he was only “restricted” or “restrained” from doing so falsely.

> Whatever the scope of a constitutional right to testify, 
> it is elementary that such a right does not extend to testifying falsely.

#### Common Law vs. Agency Law

As we have observed, 
sometimes the ethical rules differ from the common law. 
For instance, Model Rule 1.8(b) provides:

> A lawyer shall not use information 
> relating to representation of a client 
> to the **disadvantage** of the client 
> unless the client gives informed consent, 
> except as permitted or required by these Rules.

Compare the law of ageny, 
which provides that if the agent uses the the principal's information 
he must account to the principal for any profits. 
[Restatement (3rd) of Agency](https://a.next.westlaw.com/Document/Iebe0c429da4911e295e30000833f9e5b/View/FullText.html?originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default) "§ 8.05 Use of Principal's Property; Use of Confidential Information") 

An agent has a duty:

1. not to use property of the principal for the agent's own purposes or those of a third party; and
2. not to use or communicate confidential information of the principal for the agent's own purposes or those of a third party.

Never mind whether using client information 
is to the client's *disadvantage,* 
agency law imposes a higher standard on lawyers 
not to use client information period, 
at least not without client consent.

Or as [RLGL §60][RLGL-60] succinctly puts it:

> a lawyer who uses confidential information of a client 
> for the lawyer's pecuniary gain 
> other than in the practice of law 
> must account to the client for any profits made.

> When a lawyer is asked to advocate a position on a substantive legal issue that is directly contrary to the position being urged by the lawyer (or the lawyer's firm) on behalf of another client in a different and unrelated pending matter which is being litigated in the same jurisdiction, the lawyer, in the absence of consent by both clients after full disclosure, should refuse to accept the second representation if there is a substantial risk that the lawyer's advocacy on behalf of one client will create a legal precedent which is likely to materially undercut the legal position being urged on behalf of the other client. 

> If the two matters are not being litigated in the same jurisdiction and there is no substantial risk that either representation will be adversely affected by the other, the lawyer may proceed with both representations.

##### Model Rule 1.0 Terminology 

Model Rule 1.0(c):
  : "Firm" or "law firm" denotes a lawyer or lawyers in a law partnership, professional corporation, sole proprietorship or other association authorized to practice law; or lawyers employed in a legal services organization or the legal department of a corporation or other organization.

Model Rule 1.0(k):
  : "Screened" denotes the isolation of a lawyer from any participation in a matter through the timely imposition of procedures within a firm that are reasonably adequate under the circumstances to protect information that the isolated lawyer is obligated to protect under these Rules or other law.

#### Nebraska Rule 1.10

[NE Rules of Professional Conduct  Model Rule &sect;3-501.10: Imputation of conflicts of interest; general rule.](http://supremecourt.ne.gov/supreme-court-rules/1837/%C2%A7-3-50110-imputation-conflicts-interest-general-rule)

Rule 1.10, the main imputation and screening rule for the ABA, which Nebraska doesn't recognize. If you have a 1.9 conflict in Nebraska and you can't get informed consent from the former client then tough beans in Nebraska. You can't screen away the conflict, which is how I personally think it should be. But others violently disagree.

So I would say Rule 1.6 and 1.10 are the two biggies where differences abound not just in NE but in many states you go to.

> Those lawyers said they and dozens of young colleagues at their firms had casually traded pills to work into the night and billed hundreds of extra hours a year in the race for partnerships.

> One said he had originally taken 20 milligrams of Adderall a day, moving up to 100 milligrams — almost double the highest dose recommended by the Food and Drug Administration — by getting prescriptions from multiple doctors, a felony in Texas. His productivity, he said, thrilled his unquestioning bosses and clients.

> Then came the downside: rapid heartbeat, profuse sweating and acute anxiety due to sleep loss. These overwhelmed any positive effects on his work performance, he said, and transformed his personality to the point that his wife divorced him. After he lost his job, he spent six weeks at a drug treatment center.

> “It’s a crutch, and it becomes a crutch immediately,” said the lawyer, who recently joined a smaller firm in Texas.
