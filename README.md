Legal Profession

This is the document repository 
for Professor Richard Dooling's Legal Profession course 
at the University of Nebraska College of Law. 

If you read or see something that belongs here, 
please send me a link, 
especially news stories or good articles 
[IN PLAIN ENGLISH](http://www.scotusblog.com/category/plain-english/) 
on issues we discuss in class. 

If you read or write an especially apt synopsis 
of some thorny point of law we encounter in this course, 
please send it my way, and I'll include it here. 

I am especially interested in television and film, 
so please send good links to lawyer scenes. 

I add other links as needed, 
so don't be shy about nominating some for inclusion.

Please report typos and broken or misdirected links or any other web page issues.

We use Martyn & Fox, *Traversing The Ethical Minefield* 3rd Edition, 
so the folders are named according to each chapter in that text.
