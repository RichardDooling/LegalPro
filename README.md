# Legal Profession

I teach Legal Profession at the University of Nebraska College of Law, 
and this is a public repository of the files I use to teach the Legal Profession course. 

* [My University of Nebraska College of Law page](http://law.unl.edu/richard-dooling#about).
* [My Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dooling).
* [One sorely neglected blog](http://dooling.com).
* [Twitter @RichardDooling](http://twitter.com/richarddooling).

Our text for the course is [Traversing the Ethical Minefield: Problems, Law, and Professional Responsibility, Third Edition (Aspen Casebook Series) Hardcover â€“ December 20, 2012](
http://www.amazon.com/Traversing-Ethical-Minefield-Professional-Responsibility/dp/1454808144) by Susan Martyn & Edward Fox. So the folders are named according to each chapter in that text.

### Files & Folders

You don't need to know Markdown or computer programming to use or view these files. Public repositories (like this one) can be browsed and the files can be downloaded by anyone. If you are a student looking to download or view the Legal Profession files, just find the files you want and download them.

Each folder contains three files, all named after the folder:

* one Markdown file (.md)
* one Word file (.docx)
* one PDF file (.pdf)

All files contain the same content, just in different formats. For example, the Chapter_1 folder contains three files:

* Chapter_1.md
* Chapter_1.docx
* Chapter_1.pdf

If you click on the Markdown file (Chapter_1.md) you can view it as you would a webpage. 

If you click on the Chapter_1.docx or Chapter_1.pdf, you can't view the files, but you can download them if you click on the button that says "Raw." (Clicking on "View Raw" gives an error.)

### Download Zip

If you would like to download ALL of the files in this repository, look for the two buttons at the bottom of the right sidebar: "Clone in Desktop" and "Download Zip".

If you click on the "Download Zip" button, you will download a zip file containing all the files in this repository. Probably not so bad at first, but over the course of the semester more files will be added. You'll have a version problem, which is why Git and GitHub were invented. 

### Cloning

Consider investing a little time and learning how to "clone" the entire repository in your desktop. If you click on "Clone in Desktop" you will download the GitHub program, and you will be asked to create a free GitHub account. Using a simple GitHub app you will be able to quickly fetch the latest versions of these files to your computer using a simple free application available at [GitHub](https://github.com/). 

### Contributing

No obligation here. Only for the curious, but if you get interested in how GitHub works and how to contribute to this project, sign up at the [GitHub site](https://github.com/) and then read the [CONTRIBUTIONS](https://github.com/RichardDooling/LegalPro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTIONS.md).

If you read or see something that belongs here, 
please send me a link, 
especially news stories or good articles 
[IN PLAIN ENGLISH](http://www.scotusblog.com/category/plain-english/) 
on issues we discuss in class. 

If you read or write an especially apt synopsis 
of some thorny point of law we encounter in this course, 
please send it my way, and I'll include it here. 

I am especially interested in television and film, 
so please send good links to lawyer scenes. 

I add other links as needed, 
so don't be shy about nominating some for inclusion.

#### Typos, Glitches

If you spot a typo or formatting glitch please [submit an issue.](https://github.com/RichardDooling/Legal_Pro/issues). 

On the [LegalPro repository page](https://github.com/RichardDooling/LegalPro), on the right, click on the "Issues" link and describe the problem. If need be, copy in text illustrating the problem.

Issues are easy to submit, and you'll be making the text better for those who come after you.

Thank you,
